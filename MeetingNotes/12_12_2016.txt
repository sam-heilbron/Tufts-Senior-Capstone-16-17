Image Processing:

	1. Image Preprocessing (Jack S)
		-Goal is to preprocess image (with data) effectively
		-Perhaps differnet preprocessing depending on the data
		-Static threshold v adaptive threshold (which one works when)
		-Noise removal (Gaussian blur at the moment)
		-Some way of throwing out images that are too small (these are noise)
		-HOG (Histogram of Gradient) variations and the effects (block size, cell size)
		-Goal: Produce the cleanest image AND find individual characters properly

	2. Custom ML training and predictive models (Sam H)
		-Analyze / Compare various ML methods
		-Measure effectiveness of labeling images and characters (a-z and other)
		-Find datasets that help effectively train
		-See if using some methods together would be more effective
		-Possible 2 (or 3) separate ways and then they each predict (and vote)
		-Goal: Given an image, predict the value as effectively as possible (perhaps something with kids handwriting too)

	3. Number and Letter aggregate (Sam W)
		-Use pytesseract to take existing characters and determine if it's all 1 word or separate
		-Perhaps a custom ML approach is required, perhaps there's an out of the box solution
		-Make it flexible so that in some cases, a word is determined if we know it's in a word bank (like a students name), in other cases the predicted word (even though it's not in the dictionary) is presented and finally sometimes the predicted word is changed to the closest dictionary word. 
		-Focus mainly on taking existing characters and getting data. Don't worry about handwriting
		-Goal: Given a set of characters, perform aggregation to produce words/phrases
