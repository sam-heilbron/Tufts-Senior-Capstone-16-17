Model Persistence

Persist a model with a pickle

joblib.dump (and joblib.load):
	-More efficient on objects that carry large numberss of numpy arrays internally.
	-Can only pickle to disk and not to string


Security and Maintainability Limitations:
	Pickle (and joblib by extension), has some issues regarding maintainability and security.
	Never unpickle untrusted data as it could lead to malicious code being executed upon loading.
	While models saved using one version of scikit-learn might load in other versions, this is entirely unsupported and inadvisable. It should also be kept in mind that operations performed on such data could give different and unexpected results.


	In order to rebuild a similar model with future versions of scikit-learn, additional metadata should be saved along the pickled model:
		-The training data, e.g. a reference to a immutable snapshot
		-The python source code used to generate the model
		-The versions of scikit-learn and its dependencies
		-The cross validation score obtained on the training data
	This should make it possible to check that the cross-validation score is in the same range as before.
